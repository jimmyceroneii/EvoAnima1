An application I created for the non-profit I worked with. My goal was to create an interactive version of Pokemon where users
can upload their own characters.

On the backend, I started with a SQLite database and ended up moving everything over to Firebase in the end with their 
document based database. 

On the front end, I used Java to build out the application for Android (iOS is not currently supported).

The game is currently not a game. It's effectively a CRUD application for managing characters, with ideas about how to connect 
different users not yet implemented (think Pokemon battles as the goal).
